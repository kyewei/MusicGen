        This applet has the ability to write to file.

        On newer versions of Chrome, NPAPI support is disabled, which means running Java applets is disabled unless a flag in <a href="chrome://flags/">chrome://flags/</a> called "Enable NPAPI" is ticked. Unfortunately, this flag may not be available in future versions of Chrome :(

        If you are running Oracle Java, you might be able to run the applet without allowing full system access, but you won't be able to export files unless you agree to the security prompt.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are running Iced-Tea Web, it can be run once you accept the security prompt.
